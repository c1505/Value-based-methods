* Ran with default hyperparameters to start
* Ideas for Future Work
  * Hyperparameter tuning
  * running with a different algorithm
  * Increasing speed of training
  * using curiosity for exploration
  * save every x episodes
  * log more learning metrics
  * integrate with tensorboard and/or weights and biases
